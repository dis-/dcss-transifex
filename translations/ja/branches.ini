Dungeon=\nIt is still a mystery how this bizarre place was created. Some claim that it is\nthe playground of bored gods, whereas others maintain that it was shaped by all\nkinds of species who fled the overworld and shunned the light. No matter what\nits origin, this deep cavern is filled with riches unheard of as well as with\nample dangers to any intruder. Few have escaped alive, and even fewer have kept\nsome sliver of sanity sufficient to tell the tale.\n\nThe dungeon is 15 levels deep, but, honestly, this is only the beginning.\n
Temple=\nThe Ecumenical Temple is a place of peace and refuge from the insanity of the\ndungeon. It usually contains altars to most of the known gods. It is located\nbetween the levels 4 and 7 of the main dungeon.\n
Orcish Mines=\nThese bustling goldmines are filled with orcs, their humanoid labourers, and\npiles of freshly mined gold. Enterprising merchants have set up trading posts\nto help relieve the orcs of the latter. Prospective customers should be warned:\nthe haphazard manner in which orcs dig their mineshafts has resulted in a\ncomplex and treacherous tangle of chambers, in which it is easy to be trapped.\n\nThey are filled with the noise of industry, and thus all sounds travel less\nfar.\n\nThe Orcish Mines are four levels deep and contain the entrance to the Elven\nHalls.\n
Elven Halls=#This is the realm of the deep elves, a race that turned their backs on the sun\n#long ago. Their halls are filled with riches, but a deadly welcome awaits any\n#would-be robbers. In their long seclusion, the deep elves have perfected dark\n#sorceries of a power the orcs can only dream of!\n#\n#The Elven Halls are three levels deep.\n\n多くのエルフ族はこのような薄暗い地下に根城を構えたりはしない、\nこの場所の主は闇エルフだ。この大広間には多くの財宝があるが、\nこの場所に侵入する者は闇エルフたちの超越した魔力に用心せねばならない。\n\nエルフの大広間は3の階層からなる。
Lair=#Most adventurers find the Lair of Beasts to be an exciting change of climate.\n#And indeed, there is something to be said about getting gored, mauled and eaten\n#rather than sliced, burnt or stabbed.\n#\n#It is filled with the noise of nature, and thus all sounds travel less far.\n#\n#The Lair is eight levels deep and contains the stairs to three more branches.\n\n多くの冒険者は周囲の環境の急激な変化にそこが獣の巣窟であることに気づくだろう。\n事実、ここには利器を扱うのではなく、牙をつきたて、爪で切り裂き、\n獲物を食い散らかす何者かがいる。\n\n獣の棲み処は8の階層からなる。獣の棲み処は3つの分岐と繋がっている。
Swamp=\nA swampy wasteland, the Swamp is filled with ooze, muck, flies and large\nslavering carnivorous monsters.\n\nThe Swamp is five levels deep and contains the decaying rune. A dungeon\nfeatures only one of the Swamp and Shoals branches. If the Swamp is present,\nthe entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.\n
Shoals=\nThe exotic underground beaches of the Shoals make up a few small islands in a\nseemingly endless sea. The merfolk have made it their home, alongside many\ndreaded sea creatures.\n\nIt is filled with the noise of the sea breaking on sand, and thus all sounds\ntravel less far.\n\nThe Shoals are five levels deep and contain the barnacled rune. A dungeon\nfeatures only one of the Shoals and Swamp branches. If the Shoals are present,\nthe entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.\n
Snake Pit=\nThe corridors of the Snake Pit are home to all varieties of serpent, and are\ninhabited by a society of powerful nagas and salamanders.\n\nThe Snake Pit is five levels deep and contains the serpentine rune. A dungeon\nfeatures only one of the Snake Pit and Spider Nest branches. If the Snake Pit\nis present, the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.\n
Spider Nest=\nThe crumbling, web-choked caverns of the Spider Nest are packed with poisonous\narthropods and assorted creepy-crawlies.\n\nThe Spider Nest is five levels deep and contains the gossamer rune. A dungeon\nfeatures only one of the Spider Nest and Snake Pit branches. If the Spider Nest\nis present, the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.\n
Slime Pits=\nThe Slime Pits are the amorphous realm of acids, jellies and slimes. Even the\nwalls drip with painful acid, growing ever more caustic as one travels deeper.\nAny trace of intelligent beings has long been dissolved. Still, there are\nrumours of great treasures deep down, hidden safely away in secret chambers\nwithout door or window.\n\nThe only noise here is the occasional drip of acid, and thus all sounds travel\nfurther.\n\nThe Slime Pits are six levels deep and contain the slimy rune. The entry is\nbetween Lair:6 and Lair:8.\n
Vaults=\nPossibly constructed by some powerful madman, the Vaults are said to be home to\ngreat treasures. The blood spattered liberally around the entrance suggests\nthat there is a certain amount of violence, too.\n\nThe Vaults are five levels deep and contain the silver rune, as well as the\nentrances to two more branches. They can only be entered while carrying at\nleast one rune of Zot. The entrance can be found on either level 13 or 14 of\nthe main dungeon.\n
Crypt=\nThe Crypt is a huge repository for the ancient dead. The air is chill and\nfetid, the walls cold and damp. Bones are strewn liberally everywhere, and\nevery noise echoes worryingly, violating the overbearing silence of the grave.\n\nIt is suffused with the silence of the grave, and thus all sounds travel\nfurther.\n\nThe Crypt is three levels deep, and contains the entrance to the Tomb. Its entry\nis either on Vaults:2 or Vaults:3.\n
Tomb=\nThe Tomb of the Ancients is a place of damnation, of horrors animated by the\nvilest necromancy. The list of those who have returned from this place of pure\ndeath is exceedingly short.\n\nIt is suffused with the silence of the grave, and thus all sounds travel much\nfurther.\n\nThe Tomb is three levels deep and contains the golden rune. Its entry is on\nCrypt:3.\n
Hell=\nThe hallway to the four hells is guarded by Geryon. The Vestibule of Hell\ncontains portals to Dis, Gehenna, Cocytus and Tartarus.\n\nPortals to the Vestibule of Hell are found abundantly in the Depths.\n
Dis=\nWho will stand the test of iron?\n\nDis is seven levels deep and contains the iron rune. It can be accessed via the\nVestibule of Hell.\n
Gehenna=\nGehenna is a realm of flames, lava and hellfire.\n\nGehenna is seven levels deep and contains the obsidian rune. It can be accessed\nvia the Vestibule of Hell.\n
Cocytus=\nCocytus is a grim and frost-bitten wasteland.\n\nCocytus is seven levels deep and contains the icy rune. It can be accessed via\nthe Vestibule of Hell.\n
Tartarus=\nTartarus is a decaying netherworld. Over time, the undead, demons and devils of\nthis place drain the life from any who dare to enter.\n\nTartarus is seven levels deep and contains the bone rune. It can be accessed\nvia the Vestibule of Hell.\n
Zot=\nThe Realm of Zot is a region of the dungeon that is so terrifying, so full of\nmadness, frenzy and lunacy, that it has been locked securely against random\ntrespassers. Only the most demented adventurers would dare gather the required\nkeys, break the seal and penetrate deeper — all in the vain hope for a fabled\nartefact no one has ever laid eyes on before.\n\nThe Realm of Zot is five levels deep and can only be entered when carrying at\nleast three runes.\n
Abyss=\nThe Abyss is a truly bizarre place, ever-changing and twisted. It is filled\nwith all sorts of monsters, mostly of demonic nature, whose common aim is to\nfeast on intruders. It is also the garbage dump for many sorcerers, who delight\nin sending would-be champions like you to these proving grounds of madness.\nReportedly, there is some structure to the chaos, as Lugonu seems to concoct\nschemes around this place and its denizens.\n\nThe Abyss consists of five infinite levels. The abyssal rune can be found from\nthe third level onwards, and is more common at greater depths. The Abyss can be\npurposefully reached through portals in the Depths. Portals back to the dungeon\nare scattered throughout the Abyss, and are found more commonly at greater\ndepths or while carrying the abyssal rune.\n
Pandemonium=\nPandemonium is an infinite realm of pain and suffering. While there are many\ntreasures to be found within, they are guarded by cruel demons and even\ncrueller demon lords.\n\nPandemonium is endless. Portals leading there are found in the Depths. Note\nthat getting back might be more difficult.\n\nNo fewer than five runes can be found in Pandemonium:\n • a fiery rune in the well-heated realm of Cerebov\n • a glowing rune in the contaminated domain of Mnoleg\n • a magical rune guarded by the arcane powers of Lom Lobon and his minions\n • a dark rune in the shadowy abode of Gloorx Vloq\n • a demonic rune existing in multiple places, owned by less famous lords\n
Ziggurat=\nA ziggurat is a strange tower constructed of twenty seven levels of\nincrementally larger combat arenas, each containing greater wealth and even\ngreater danger than the last. Beware, for a ziggurat is not a place for the\nfaint of heart: even the bravest and most skilled adventurers have met their\nends in one. While a portal to safety will be present on every level, once\nleft, a ziggurat cannot be re-entered.\n\nOne ziggurat is guaranteed in the Depths, and further ones can be found\nin Pandemonium. These towers and their contents will react violently to\nthose that can conquer them, and scale up according to how many ziggurats\nan adventurer has completed.\n\nIt can only be entered when carrying at least two runes of Zot.\n
Labyrinth=\nThe labyrinth is a complex, ever-shifting maze designed by subtle and malicious\nminds for reasons long lost to history. Old stories say that the labyrinth was\nconstructed as a prison for a fearsome minotaur. More recent stories say this\nbeast dwells there still, guarding the labyrinth's sole exit — as well as a\nrich hoard of treasure taken from the bodies of foolish adventurers.\n
Bazaar=\nWhile some merchants set up shop in the dungeon, others travel in caravans from\nplace to place. The bazaars of these intinerant traders feature a number of\ndifferent shops and often have better stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes\neven at a bargain.\n
Trove=\nOnce upon a time, an enterprising thief and wizard created a system of portals\nleading into the secret treasure troves and chambers of the rich. Too scared to\nloot them himself, he instead charged an extortionate fee for entry to anyone\nwho wanted to rifle through them.\n\nThe items inside this trove are likely to be useful, but beware: the wizard is\nlong dead, and even while alive he never offered a money-back guarantee.\n
Sewer=#Every inhabited place needs to dispose of its waste products. The Dungeon too\n#has its stinking sewers and drains, full of filthy water and ignored by most\n#but used as hideaways by the disgusting and the desperate. Old tales speak of\n#dangerous creatures stalking through the foul-smelling green water, preying on\n#each other without mercy. The tales also allude to valuable items accidentally\n#washed into the drainage tunnels, forgotten and left to grow mouldy in the damp\n#caverns.\n\n遍く人の住むところには廃棄物を処理する場所が必要だ。\nこのダンジョンにも汚水に満たされ異臭を放つ下水道と排水溝があり、\n多くのものはこれを顧みないが、不快なものや恐ろしいものの棲み処となっている。\n古い言い伝えによれば、危険な生き物が腐臭を放つ緑の水の中から忍び寄り、\n無慈悲にも獲物を捕食するという。言い伝えにはそのジメジメした洞窟には、\n誤って排水管に流してしまった価値ある物品が忘れられ、\nカビの生えるままにされていることも仄めかされている。
Ossuary=\nThe ossuary is a small tomb containing the remains and grave goods of some\ndistant relatives of the pharaohs, along with the corpses of their retainers\nand household animals. It is undoubtedly riddled with many traps, and its\nundead denizens are unlikely to take kindly to looting.\n
Bailey=\nThe bailey is the still-occupied and well-guarded fortress of an orcish lord.\nThe treasures within are protected by both physical barriers and large numbers\nof well-armed humanoid warriors.\n
Ice Cave=\nThe ice cave is a desolate cavern shaped from solid ice and filled with the\nechoes of bestial howls. The intricate carvings and statues which once lined\nits walls have been warped and obscured by centuries of slow melting and\nrefreezing.\n
Volcano=#Built from enormous blocks of obsidian, this sweltering chamber may once have\n#served as a temple to some strange deity, or perhaps the dwelling of a mighty\n#fire giant. The air shimmers with oppressive heat, and the dull roar of the\n#volcano's heart never ceases.\n\n黒曜石の巨岩から作られた茹だるように暑い空間は、\nかつては幾分変わった神の祭壇であったか、\nおそらくは強力なファイアジャイアントのねぐらとして用いられたものだろう。\n耐え難い暑さに大気は揺らめき、火山の心臓は鈍い轟きを止めることはないだろう。
Wizlab=\nIn ages past, the most powerful mages would frequently find or construct small\nrealms sealed off from the rest of the world, where they could isolate\nthemselves in the pursuit of ever-greater magical knowledge and power. The\nmages are long gone, but many of their arcane laboratories still exist, filled\nwith the results of their experiments. Those willing to explore these\nlaboratories may find powerful magical treasures, but be warned: any wizard\ncapable of constructing such a realm deserved their reputation.\n
Depths=\nThe Depths are the deepest part of the dungeon proper, subject to the\ncorrupting influence of the Realm of Zot without being considered a part of it.\n\nThe Depths are five levels deep and can be entered from the lowest floor of the\nDungeon.\n
