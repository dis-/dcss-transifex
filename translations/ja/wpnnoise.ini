The sword is rational, sometimes introspective.\n# It is somewhat educated (mostly about music and war) and likes to show off.\n# Typical speech verb: "says"\n#\n# Low tension:\n# Speech is common, somewhat loud (do wake up nearby monsters) and slightly\n# damages everyone in sight. The sword is calm and cool. It enjoys the\n# bloodshed, but is sane. Of course, work is more fun with a little tune...\n# Typical speech verbs: "says" or "shouts".\n#\n# High tension:\n# Speech is very common, extremely loud (you may use CAPS) and does more\n# damage. Messages are insane, the sword is out of control.\n# At high tension, the sword may SCREAM, doing even more damage.\n# Typical speech verb: "shouts" or @_screams_@\n#\n#\n# Generally, the Sword is arrogant: it sees itself as the main hero, with the\n# wielder just being a disposable tool/fool.
